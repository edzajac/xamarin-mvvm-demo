# Xamarin-MVVM-Demo

This project is a simple demonstration of how the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern is leveraged within a basic Xamarin.Forms mobile application. Other key notes of implementation in this solution include a demonstration of dependency injection being leveraged within each view model as well as an overriden Command file that could provide a tie-in for analytics down the line.

## Getting Started

For this project, you will require a development environment that handles Xamarin projects. Go to the following link if you require more information on how to accomplish this: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/get-started/installation/windows 

Also, to properly build for both iOS and Android, you will require either an Apple device and/or Mac build host (iOS) and either an Android device and/or Android emulators (Android) which you can setup on Visual Studio itself. For more information on how to accomplish either of these tasks, check out the following links.
